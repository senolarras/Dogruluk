# PSR Http Message Util

This repository holds utility classes and constants to facilitate common
operations of [PSR-7](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/); the primary purpose is
to provide constants for referring to request methods, response status codes and
messages, and potentially common headers.

Implementation of PSR-7 interfaces is **not** within the scope of this package.
